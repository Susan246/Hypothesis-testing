# Hypothesis Testing

- This project investigates the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and non-performing loans (NPLs) in Nepal through hypothesis testing.
- We specifically examine whether various macroeconomic variables—such as the actual growth rate, forecasted growth rate, per capita GDP growth, and others—exert a significant positive influence on non-performing loans and defaults. The analysis employs statistical methods, including correlation analysis and hypothesis testing, to assess the strength and direction of these relationships.
- By integrating historical macroeconomic data with loan performance metrics, our goal is to clarify how economic conditions affect loan default rates and overall financial stability. This approach helps in understanding the impact of economic fluctuations on loan performance and guides policy-making for financial stability.
